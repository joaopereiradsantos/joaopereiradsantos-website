João Pereira dos Santos is a **Chemical Engineer** specialized in **Processes & Product** from Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto (**[FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en)**) currently working as a **Business Intelligence Engineer** for the EU Supply Chain Analytics Team at **Amazon** - world’s largest online marketplace, AI assistant provider, live-streaming platform and cloud computing platform as measured by revenue and market capitalization.

During his degree, he won the 2018 Academic Games of Engineering by AEFEUP: a group project aiming at designing a continuous hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) biomass processing unit for Paralab, SA; and was also 3x Team Leader at the European BEST Engineering Competition Challenge - Team Design: a practical test consisting on the construction of a prototype with limited materials and low cost to solve a proposed problem.

As a **Data Science** enthusiast, João is intellectually curious and eager to learn and apply new Data-Oriented skill sets into daily challenges. During his **Master Thesis** Project at **Amkor Technology** he wrote  _“Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis in Copper Electroplating Baths”_, where KPIs for Chemical Process Control were implemented on a Microsoft Power BI Dashboard. He started competing in beginner Kaggle Competitions and participated on the 2020 EUREKAthon - [Challenge Data for Zero Hunger](https://www.eurekathon.com/2020/index.html): a data-driven competition that addresses societal issues associated with sustainable development goals, later winning Hack@Home III by Tech@Catolica - [A Second Wave Forecast of COVID-19 cases](https://github.com/joaopereiradsantos/covid19-second-wave-forecast) using **Machine Learning** time series forecasting models like Auto-ARIMA, FB Prophet, XGBoost and Neural Networks.
